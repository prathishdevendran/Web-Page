            <div class="section2 effect">An ecosystem refers to a community of living organisms, such as plants and animals, interacting with each other and their non-living environment. It includes the physical, chemical and biological components of a specific area, and how they work together to create a system that is self-sustaining. Ecosystems can be found on different scales, from small ponds to entire biomes such as deserts or rainforests. They are important for maintaining biodiversity, regulating climate, and providing various ecosystem services that are essential to human life.</div>
