                    <h2>The Structure</h2> of an ecosystem is characterised by the organisation of both biotic and abiotic components. This includes the distribution of energy in our environment. It also includes the climatic conditions prevailing in that particular environment. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <pre>The structure of an ecosystem can be split into two main components, namely: 
                
                <a href="#bio_comp">1. Biotic Components</a>
                <a href="#abio_comp">2. Abiotic Components.</a>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    The biotic and abiotic components are interrelated in an ecosystem. It is an open system where the energy and components can flow throughout the boundaries.

                <p><h3>Biotic components</h3> refer to all living components in an ecosystem.  Based on nutrition, biotic components can be categorised into autotrophs, heterotrophs and saprotrophs (or decomposers).

                    Producers include all autotrophs such as plants. They are called autotrophs as they can produce food through the process of photosynthesis. Consequently, all other organisms higher up on the food chain rely on producers for food.
                    Consumers or heterotrophs are organisms that depend on other organisms for food. Consumers are further classified into primary consumers, secondary consumers and tertiary consumers.
                    Primary consumers are always herbivores as they rely on producers for food.
                    Secondary consumers depend on primary consumers for energy. They can either be carnivores or omnivores.
                    Tertiary consumers are organisms that depend on secondary consumers for food.  Tertiary consumers can also be carnivores or omnivores.
                    Quaternary consumers are present in some food chains. These organisms prey on tertiary consumers for energy. Furthermore, they are usually at the top of a food chain as they have no natural predators.
                    Decomposers include saprophytes such as fungi and bacteria. They directly thrive on the dead and decaying organic matter.  Decomposers are essential for the ecosystem as they help in recycling nutrients to be reused by plants.
