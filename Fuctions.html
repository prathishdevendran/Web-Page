                    <h2>Functions of Ecosystem</h2>
The functions of the ecosystem are as follows:
It regulates the essential ecological processes, supports life systems and renders stability.
<br>
It is also responsible for the cycling of nutrients between biotic and abiotic components.
It maintains a balance among the various trophic levels in the ecosystem.
It cycles the minerals through the biosphere.
<br>
The abiotic components help in the synthesis of organic components that involve the exchange of energy.
So the functional units of an ecosystem or functional components that work together in an ecosystem are:
<br><br>
<h4>Productivity:</h4> It refers to the rate of biomass production.
<br><br>
<h4>Energy flow:</h4> It is the sequential process through which energy flows from one trophic level to another. The energy captured from the sun flows from producers to consumers and then to decomposers and finally back to the environment.
<br><br>
<h4>Decomposition:</h4> It is the process of breakdown of dead organic material. The top-soil is the major site for decomposition.
<br><br>
<h4>Nutrient cycling:</h4> In an ecosystem nutrients are consumed and recycled back in various forms for the utilisation by various organisms.
